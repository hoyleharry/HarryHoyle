## FAQ
* Can I use it for any personal/commercial project?
-> Yes. But don't change/remove the `fork icon` and the `URL it redirects to` at the `TOP-RIGHT corner`. So that, others can also benefit from the repository.

* Can I use it for making my personal/commercial portfolio? 
-> Definitely. But make sure you FORK it while doing it :)

* Can I share your portfolio link with my friends?
-> DEFINITELY! ^_^

* Can I contact you if I get stuck while trying to create my own portfolio using the forked source code?
-> DEFINITELY! :)

## How to contribute?
Lately, people have been making pull requests just to show their github username in the contributors list. Which I don't think is a good way to be an Open Source contributor. So, here's a few identified bugs: https://github.com/p32929/p32929.github.io/blob/react/BUGS.md

If you think you can fix the bugs, you may:
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Create a new branch from the `react` branch with your github username [ Example: My github username is `p32929` ]
4. Write your code
5. Add necessary changes to the readme if needed
6. Commit the code
7. Push the code in your branch
8. Create a new pull request

You're welcome...
